It was the headquarters of Faizabad district and Faizabad division until 6 November 2018, when the Uttar Pradesh cabinet headed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath approved the renaming of Faizabad district as Ayodhya, and the shifting of the administrative headquarters of the district to Ayodhya city. Faizabad is situated on the banks of river Ghaghra (locally known as Saryu) about 130 km east of state capital Lucknow. It was the first capital of the Nawabs of Awadh and has monuments built by the Nawabs, like the Tomb of Bahu Begum, Gulab Bari.
The earliest reference made to Ayodhya is said to be in the Ramayana, in which the city is referred to as Saket, the mythical private estate of King Dashrath father of Lord Ram but the other sources indicate that Saket, which means Heaven in Sanskrit, is the ancient name of holy city of Ayodhya not Faizabad. However, more accurately, the reference is found in Medieval and Modern history, when Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, Burhan-ul-Mulk was given the charge of the Subah of Awadh around 1722 by the Mughal Court. Nawab Sa'adat Khan made the first settlements along the banks of Ghaghra with a cantonment consisting of a fortress and mud barracks. Due to these temporary dwellings, Faizabad was first known as 'Bangla' (implied meaning- hutment).

Establishment of Princely state of Avadh
Avadh, a princely state of India, was established around 1722 AD with Faizabad as its capital and Saadat Ali Khan I as its first Nawab and progenitor of Nawabs of Awadh. He laid the foundation for his own palace at Saket on the outskirt of ancient city of Ayodhya, and renamed that city to Faizabad, which became the capital of the new government. Due to his management policy state's income rose from Rs.7 to 20 million.[citation needed]

Faizabad further developed as a township during the reign of Safdar Jang, the second nawab of Avadh (1739â€“54), who made it his military headquarters while his successor Shuja-ud-daula made it full-fledged capital city.</i></h4></p>
