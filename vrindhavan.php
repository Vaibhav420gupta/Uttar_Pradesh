Near the monument are the Narada Kund, where Bhakti Sutra verses were written by Narada, and the Sri Radha Vana Bihari Temple.
                    It was constructed by the Jat rulers of the Bharatpur. Maharaja Suraj Mal constructed the sarovar and garden for his queen Kishori Rani.[citation needed]

The building, with cenotaphs of the Bharatpur royal family, was built by Maharaja Jawahir Singh, the king of Bharatpur (1707–1763), in honor of his father MahaRaja Suraj Mall in 1764. Members of his family died during the 18th century fighting the British.

It is named for the Kilakinchita Lila legend about female cow herders (gopis) who picked flowers for offerings to the Sun God, Surya Deva for the nearby Surya Deva Temple and met with Krishna and his friend Madhumangala, who vanish and disguise themselves as priests and accept the flowers and sweets at the temple. Sarovar means lake and kusum means flowers. It was described by Henry George Keene in 1878, "On every side of the reservoir that fronts it, handsome landing-places run out into the still water with deep and wide staircases between; a venerable banyan tree shades the south side, and sends it pendant shoots towards the water… The spot is singular in its repose, its silence, and its irregular charms.</i></h4></p>
